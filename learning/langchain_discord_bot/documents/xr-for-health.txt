Message: <@747494247766163596> we aren't using any GAN or ML in our project, as we ended up moving away from the idea of using synthetic data during the first week of development. 

"This project utilizes computer vision and large language models (LLMs) to develop a health visualization platform that synthesizes realistic depictions of dermatological conditions across a spectrum of skin tones using color correction algorithms and techniques. The platform is designed to support precise visual and textual analysis, enhancing the inclusivity and accuracy of medical imaging."

I think this is about as technical as we can get

```Description: This project focuses on the development of a health visualization platform that involves the creation of realistic textures of skin diseases for awareness and medical-education applications. The project explores the use of large language models (LLMs) and computer vision models to provide educational enumerations on the defining visual characteristics of the skin lesions. The platform visualizes for a diverse range of skin tones, addressing gaps in medical imaging.```

Could you guys give me a small description to put in the poster in the space we have reserved for you? I'd prefer formal terms (more research and technical focused). Heard you guys used GAN and ML which are not worded quite much here so can you drop in here a 2/3 sentence description about the project tailored towards pasting in a research poster please!

Message: <@&1253414412174491738> Here's what I currently have the scene looking like right now as a prototype (after giving up on Blender), I wanted to throw out a prototype to get ideas and wonder if I'm going the right way. But looking at the current build, I think I modeled it too much to look like a mall or something (I haven't added any of the futuristic components yet but the floating screens will have something related to that soon when I figure it out)

- I added the leaves because I was curious if you guys thought maybe a futuristic/biophilic theme would be fitting and if I should do more like add plants or something 
- What kinds of things do you think I could add to make it look more futuristic? 
- I plan on at least extending the room at least horizontally to make it look a little less cramped? maybe

But really any idea kind of helps rn since I'm kind of stuck

I did this on Ue5 today! What I'm visualizing is having the user press a key and then this scanning effect will play, and after it is played, the lesions on the skin of the 3D model will stay highlighted for further inspection. This would also prompt a textbox that calls Alexis' chatbot! Let me know any thoughts or suggestions!

<@927744258528673842> pointed out this github repository: https://github.com/gcastro-98/synthetic-medical-images

This is a GAN that is trained to produce pictures of melanoma, as well as other skin pathologies. We should definitely look into using this.

Message: If we get access to Google Colab pro, I think the training times would be decreased since it offers better GPUs to work with (but I think we should experiment first)

Message: I kind of found this tutorial a bit hard to follow, and noticed that he was using Jupyter Lab (which might make training a bit more difficult since it uses your GPU specifically to work with)

I found that the tensorflow websites give pretty good detailed tutorials on designing your own GAN, and also they make use of Google Colab, an entirely free resource that gives you access to T4 GPUs for machine learning/training. This means that you don't have to have a computer with high specifications to develop a GAN.

This is a DCGAN tutorial from TensorFlow that I thought looked helpful:
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan#setup

And here is a StyleGAN2/3 tutorial that teaches you to implement your own dataset (I'm currently looking at it right now):
https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/t81_558_class_07_2_train_gan.ipynb

I think these resources would be easier to use to learn, and also provides everyone on our team the ability to do ML without needing use of a really good computer (training times might still be long)

Message: Hey <@&1253414412174491738> ! I talked with some of you about meeting availability, and some of you made me aware of exceptions. 

As far as meetings go, we will meet every Tuesday (starting tomorrow) from 11:00 - 12:30 in Room 645. However, I also wanted to change up my schedule by adding a Monday shift to better fit everyone else's. This would open up Monday as another day we could all meet, which would help all of us to stay in the loop.

For our initial meeting tomorrow, our agenda covers introductions, discussing the project overview, answering questions, and also providing individual assignments.

I created a scope of work document for this project so that we can all get a better idea of whats to come. I've also created a pipeline diagram to give a high-level overview of how our text-to-texture modality will work.

Professor Matthew Briggs of UArizona Health Sciences Design leads development this summer in pursuit of a novel technique leveraging LLM and Computer Vision models to create convincing PBR Textures for medical simulation. By pioneering physically based rendering the team will create a "text-to-texture" modality for AI ‚Äì bringing to life highly realistic avatars and NPCs in real-time.
