If anyone has any ideas for the architecture let us know, ideas don't have to be polished, more ideas the better! 

Be sure to send your schedules so we can set up working times and also check out the Matthew Berman video I sent earlier and do more research on LangChain or agentic architectures/AI agents. If you find something cool (even if you think other ppl might know it already) definitely share it! The more sharing that happens, the quicker we'll all learn!

Once I have all your emails I'll work with COT IT to get you all added to the MS Teams. It was great meeting you all today!
