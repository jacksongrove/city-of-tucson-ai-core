Message: <@&1254870550694854707> By the end of the week, please have your presentation filled out, so I can review it and leave some feedback. There is also a notes feature on Canva, so on each slide I want you all to put your names on the slides you will be presenting and leave small notes about what you expect to say about that slide during the presentation instead of doing it on Google Docs. Let me know if there is anything I can do to further support you all.

Message: Guideline for ideating/brainstorming:
Each person takes their own turn to share their idea (ideally about 5 minutes each). When it’s their turn and there’s confusion about it, use the whiteboard to write down each important component of the idea. This gives the opportunity for a team member to point out specifically in the writing what they don’t understand. If there’s still disagreement, other people who are in similar understanding can expand upon their explanations to better clarify. If no agreement is settled within the next minute or so, the group must move on to adhere to schedule.

This is a simple outline we can follow to avoid hiccups. We can improve on this guideline and talk it further the next day we meet (tomorrow)

If not, there are super simple beginner CTF puzzles you can find on picoCTF just to get a glimpse of what they look like without creating them, Making your own challenges is more difficult so I don’t think you need to worry about that. <@433811697963237397>
