Message: Hi <@&1254878080070189086> team (and <@1062863385798115349>) I've spoken directly with <@1235948051877724210> and <@407627908761387019> and want to make clear that I've asked Jackson to take over the management and execution of this project for the remainder of the summer session (from now until August 9th).  Manuel, Cami, Sebastian, Elina, and Annie, please continue to work with Jackson in the days ahead to bring this project over the finish line.  There is a concrete plan to be built here:

-) Establish a FREE and a PAID RAG databases based on The Play District data
-) Attach both RAGS to a chatbot running in OpenAI with logic for determining if the user is allowed access to the paywall or not
-) Get that chatbot running in WebFlow and teach the new developer Nathan how to leverage/code it
-) Build a process for updating the RAGs easily, or automatically
-) Setup Play District wholly in their own commercial cloud

Team, please share out the side tasks that you've been developing with Jackson and what's great about them but also follow his lead in the accomplishment of the 5 above tasks. With 3 weeks to go there is still a good chance that all of this can be accomplished, and I'm sure you'll all appreciate leveraging some of the cool RAG and Agent solutions that Jackson and the AI Engineers have been discovering!

If this isn't clear please drop by HQ or send me a DM for qualifications.

Elina, thanks for your stewardship of this project to date, please continue to make your contributions as this team focuses on the final 3 weeks.

Thanks all,
