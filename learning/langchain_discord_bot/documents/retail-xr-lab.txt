Message: the good thing: clothes and all objects can be separated
the regular thing: we might have to work with XR devs equipment as the project progresses, this model was hard to digest for my computer and nearly impossible for Mollie's
the not-so-great thing: since meshes were separated, some clothes come in parts (for example, for the cap the crown and the bill are separated), we'll want to merge them in a blueprint which is not a hard process at all but has to be done for most of the clothes. On the other hand, some clothes (the ones that are the hangers, one after another), come all together, if you grab one, you'll grab the 5 of them. To address that we can work with the subdivisions of the mesh. These are all high poly so there is no trouble, but again, is a process. I will add to the documentation a video on how to merge meshes and I will do a video on how to work with subdivisions to separate the clothes in the hangers <@864537084790177813>

if this works we can come up with a way to divide the different pieces of work within the sublevels to be able to work on them independently.

You will see I already did an alteration to the scan that was to fix the glass wall from the outside and inside, I did a video on how I did that and will upload it to the repo later today or tomorrow.

Message: I started a free trial on Polycam to try the different exporting formats to see if any of them was better than .GLB, I had good faith that maybe FBX would be the best option but it actually was not capturing all the sides of the mesh. I also tried OBJ but at the end I decided GLB is still the best option. Something good, remember that I said that all the scan would export as one mesh and it would be laborious to separate it? I figured out how to work with it and that all the elements are automatically separated, I will make tutorials for everything

Message: The AI Core / Norton XR Retail Lab Scope of Work: We will implement a first-generation AI analysis system within the Norton School of Human Ecology Retail Sciences Lab in preparation for launch Fall 2024.  AI components will integrate with existing sensing technology as much as feasible to enable real-time computer vision, audio, and other sensor input analysis of in-store activity via a v1 UI.  Additional goals include exploration of a v1 Digital Twin environment (also for analysis and visualization of in-store activity as well as simulation testing) and the exploration of multiplayer mixed-reality in-store experiences via Meta Quest 3 and Unreal Engine 5 development.
