Message: Questions for the chatbot - 

- What might parents ask the chatbot?

What is VAULT?
What if my child doesn’t have a speech problem?
Can I use this for older children?
I don’t see a word I want to teach on here?
What if I don’t have one of the materials?
I am not sure if I am doing this right? How will I know?
How do I get my child to pay attention to what I’m teaching?
Why do you say it so many times?
Will my child get bored?
How do I find a speech therapist for my child?
What words should I teach my toddler?
When should I worry about my child&#39;s talking development?
How do I teach words to kids?


- What might interventionists ask the Chabot?


What is VAULT?
How is this different from other therapies?
What if I don’t have 30 minutes to work on vocabulary?
I see the sample activities only use 5 doses. Is that enough?
Does this work for autistic children?
How can I check for fidelity?
How do you take data for this treatment?
How will I know if it is working?
Does it work better than other treatments?
How long should this treatment last?

this is an awesome tool when considering human centered design (HCD). The tool ensures color contrasts adhere to a standard for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). WCAG mostly focuses on accessibility with those with disabilities however I think some aspects can be taken from there to improve the design of a website when considering HCD.

A good website to reference at least for the accessibility available since the focus is on learning. I think the options provided help with the goals of the learning vault which is to help toddlers and kids learn. The way these options get there, is through accommodating for and considering other issues that children who are delayed learners might encounter have. I personally found the ADHD friendly profile to be incredibly helpful as it casts a shadow around the area the mouse isn't directly over to help with focus.
