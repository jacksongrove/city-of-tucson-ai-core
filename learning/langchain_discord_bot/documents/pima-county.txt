Message: gotcha - we're getting down to the wire here, so I would focus on the presentation. We need to have a world where we can implement the cacti, which at this point will likely be the colossal caves one. So once that's done, and the cactus can be implemented there, then go ahead and move on to the presentation.

I know the project itself is still a work in progress but since our final presentation/product demo is in three weeks, we'll be getting started today. Lucy made us a very nice reference/template to use, but we have to make our own just based off of the content in the canva I'm going to send. I think we can make it look really cool, especially with some of the canva templates I've seen today with my other groups.

Message: <@&1254871480181723189> Hello team, we're taking a field trip to Colossal Cave to attempt a digital twin.  Travel to occur as soon as feasible.  It is a one day excursion and does not require Travel Authorization.  We have to put our heads together to determine the best method for transporation.  The project design is a) create digital twin of a Pima County attraction (Colossal Cave) b) acquire documents from PCVC about Colossal Cave, create a RAG database about the cave with <@&1229907313436000256> and drop The Saguaros into the digital twin with the RAG database attached (instant tour guide).  

<@290979217556897792> please organize with your team to arrange travel dates and discuss transportation.  <@864537084790177813> we also want representation from the <@&1253410242771947600> team, as your team is running away with Digital Twinning.  <@1163029733076910081> is already onboard.  Mollie, please coordinate with Chris and your team, and <@1062863385798115349> and myself regarding travel dates and transportation modes.

We will use Polycam and iPhones with LiDAR.  I have an iPhone 13 max to add to the mix.  We need several scanner concurrently.

I propose we give ourselves a test run before heading to the cave... let's form a team of personnel and give ourselves 180 minutes to scan the entire first floor of the HSIB building.  We can then stitch it all together in UE5.  This will be our bootcamp/learning experience.  All <@&1232060265428811847> can assist with the model imports/staging/output to XR stages as well.

Will follow-up in-person.  All crew stoked for this please show up at HQ and get involved.  Sounds like an awesome project!

Message: Kristopher Brough up a good point to me earlier today 
He asked what he should learn to that would be benificial to the project and I thought that was a excilent question.

<@290979217556897792> Do you think it would be a good idea to break people off into their roles and have them get really good at it?
Example, 1 - 2 people are really good at unreal
Another good at scanning and importing (its not hard so they can learn other thing but have scanning as the main)
Have another person work on the AI 
And then lastly another making the 3d moddles for the cactus and animations ??

Message: First, a Small update, it seems that Poly cam decides which type of chairs are used on a random basis.
Second, we are currently working on uploading the 3d file to Unreal, but it breaks up each element (A chair, a table) into a individual item to be added to the environment, we are currently learning how to properly upload it to unreal

Message: What is lacking after some testing is that this is all the detail you will get with room scans, to make it more detailed for the final project we will need to do scans that include small object level quality but for the entire area or room. I will do some testing to figure out how much time that takes

Message: Hi <@&1254871480181723189> , listen up <@&1229907313436000256> and <@&1232060265428811847> here is the plan for the Visitor Center NPC AI project.  It is simple, straight-forward, and powerful.

We will build a digital twin of a Tucson area attraction (probably either Colossal Cave or the Titan Missle Museum, but there are few other options) and make an experience people can explore at the Visitor's Center in XR.  We'll build a RAG database specializing in the lore and significance of the attraction and attach it to one of The Saguaros.  We'll insert the Cacti friend into the scene where it can interact with the user and the environment, all while powered by the RAG.  A digital guide and companion...   The Saguaros can power *many* attractions... this will be epic, and we can do it.

It was a hard start today but we are on track for a fun build.  I'm working on buying a workstation or two for the office.  <@290979217556897792>  let's work to build a workflow so that team members can be productive in Apporto.  Work done in Apporto can be shared so that scenes are ultimately compiled and shipped to headset by any developer in the XR Lounge.

Message: Hey there team! As talked about with Ash earlier (with the couple of you that were there). We're pivoting directions yet again to a new goal. As of now, Ash suggested we work in UE to get used to the systems - so the plan is to mostly just play around in there.

We'll have Alex (as the only one with LIDAR) scan and import objects around the office into a Git repository, then the rest of you can import those into UE and place them around the digital office space (the point being to get used to UE). You can also import models from the internet if you would like. 

Keep in mind at some point we still will be working on the Pima County Project, however it is no longer the central focus (due to various factors). At some point we will return to it. 

Next, we will attempt to work with metahumans in UE, perhaps making copies of ourselves to import into the digital office space. We could (theoretically) create a multiplayer space in which we can all run around as ourselves in our digital office. 

That's all I have for now, but please let me know if there are questions and I will answer them as best as I can, and / or ask Ash on your behalf. üôÇ
