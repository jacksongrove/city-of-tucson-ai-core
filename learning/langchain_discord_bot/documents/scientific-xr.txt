Message: **COGS 500: Computing for the Research Lab
3-credit, asynchronous, iCourse - Fall 2024:** 

1st 7.5 week session 08/26/2024-10/16/2024

**Syllabus**: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qdd50THw6s8LmLz2o-Ci6Wxdm0XLtuxytDcRdQhVrWA/edit?usp=sharing

Research labs need computationally competent students who can identify and solve hardware, network, and software problems. This course is ideal for students who would like to improve their abilities to contribute to research by enhancing their technical expertise. It provides fundamental concepts, vocabulary, advice, and experience, enabling students to be more confident, productive, and organized members of any research lab.

Students with a broad range of backgrounds will benefit from COGS 500 and it does not assume you know anything about computers! This friendly, asynchronous, 3-credit, graduate-level iCourse offers plenty of hands-on experience and will empower you to handle topics like:

- Best practices for organizing research files and directories
- How to select the right computer hardware
- Why the network is down, and how to troubleshoot it
- Going beyond Excel (Relational databases, OpenRefine, Tableau)
- Working with the Unix command line, 
- Using and understanding Docker Containers, 
- Introduction to programming: Python and Matlab
- MATLAB and digital signal processing
- And much more!

No prerequisites‚Ä¶.really!

You can find the course in the Class Search: https://studentcenter.arizona.edu/app/ui/public/select-campus

Main Campus: Subject COGS, Catalog Number 500

This course can be counted towards the **Certificate in Neuroimaging Methods**: 
https://cogsci.arizona.edu/programs/certificate and is a prerequisite for **Computing for Neuroimagers**.


Contact Dianne Patterson, Ph.D ([dkp@arizona.edu](mailto:dkp@arizona.edu)) with any questions. Upper division undergraduates are welcome (there are some extra forms)

Message: Region extraction: Another possible solution.  I have a tool that extracts a mean value for each region of interest in the brain.  Thus, a few different levels instead of true gradients.  These are choropleth-like visualizations: https://neuroimaging-core-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/choropleths.html. and I can produce a NIfTI file of such values.  I've provided 2 example files in box, both based on IC3_run1: 
 HO-CB_IC3_run1_0_stats.nii.gz retains all regions with positive stats values. https://arizona.box.com/s/lt25w9ayucfxh2do0ciafncp0erxxszc
HO-CB_IC3_run1_1.3_stats.nii.gz retains only those positive values greater than or equal to t=1.3
https://arizona.box.com/s/rz908x45jf9qhu0uct6heqxoci3gs8yo

Gradients are prettier though ; )

Message: I should have mentioned: The IC I gave you all is one of several interacting ICs, that all overlap and change.  Here's one of the relevant papers.  I guess, the point is, once you get the technical details of exporting gradients worked out (fingers crossed) then we COULD add considerably more detail and complexity....

Finally, the IC number I gave you does not correspond nicely to the IC numbers reported in the paper (Comp 1 in the paper corresponds to the IC you've got).

We have the go ahead from the folks at Catalyst for that entire week (except Tuesday, emails attached). We can work our usual 4 hour block at Catalyst that day if you prefer (we'll have to plan for that accordingly: bring appropriate hardware for testing). 

Once we decide, I'll send a reply-all email with the verdict.

I'm giving you guys these options:
(a) Monday 29/7/24 11:30 AM - 3:30 PM - Vote for this with üìÖ 
- (Work that day's whole shift at Catalyst)
(b)  Monday 29/7/24 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM - Vote for this with ‚òÄÔ∏è
- (Work 2 hours of that day's shift at Catalyst and come back for the last hour)
(c) Wednesday 31/7/24 11:30 AM - 3:30 PM - Vote for this with ‚õ±Ô∏è 
- (Alternative if people can't make it on Monday)

Message: Kyle & Maryam Daily Report: Figured out how to use Blender to reduce the polygon count in order to eliminate lag. We found that setting the ratio to 0.850 on decimate geometry was optimal to keep detail high and lag at a minimum. Additionally, we found out how to edit graphic preferences in MetaQuest. Set up Unreal Engine for an AR setting, but have not had success in getting it to run. Plug-ins were enabled, however, we discovered that the video we were using to guide us was designed to set up AR via a mobile app, where as we want MetaQuest. More research is needed to continue with the project

Message: These are great questions. Both look healthy to me. The brain on the left has probably retained CSF, which fills in all the sulci (valleys).  I'm betting this was a volume, rather than a surface, and was saved as a surface, without any further cleanup. 

The one on the right, I think, is already a cleaned up surface, so they made sure it looked nice and you could see into all the sulci.  So, surfice offers you several nice clean looking surfaces like this. They are all "standard brains", meaning  an average of many brains, typically all normal young adults....so it doesn't represent a single real person.  Because it is a standard average brain, it may not make sense to ask if it is healthy.

Interestingly, sulci are bigger and more pronounced in aging brains because the tissue shrinks, leaving more and more fluid.  This means it is easier to clean up an elderly brain and get a nice "look".

Message: Pardon the crappy audio, here's the quick rundown of the meta XR plugin and deploying to the Quest 3. Take note of the deployment steps.

Watch this first thing once you guys get here, since the target tomorrow is to get every one of you guys to deploy the template project to the Quest 3 tomorrow. 

I haven't made Trello entries for the video since I just did one video instead of the two (so just make sure to watch the one video, no Trello tracking involved). I didn't make the second one which I thought I would make on the conversion from .nii->.fbx since there are quite a few ways to achieve that for the base brain, (I'll live demo 2 ways tomorrow and we can select which one we want to commit to) and we still haven't figured out how to convert the IC (overlay) files.

Message: This is "BrainMesh_ICBM152.lh.mz3" (from the BrainNet samples folder) with 'motor_4t95vol.nii.gz' overlaid with different min/max ranges. 
I've saved them into .OBJ files and then converted them into .FBX for UE5 using fusion360. I suppose my approach is flawed as the going to .OBJ loses all color information from the overlay?
The grey images are from loading the final .fbx files in UE5, the green images are from fusion360.

Maybe I just need to understand the encoding for each of the file formats and look at one which can encode the information from the overlaid scans.

I'm also not sure if threshold is what we need to worry about or how that is supposed to help in this instance since I think I'm losing color info going from .nii->.obj

Maybe it could be helpful if we could meet and whiteboard some ideas out after I familiarize myself with at least .nii, .obj and .fbx encodings

RE: Surf Ice Overlap HELP
You can overlay a statistical map in two ways, as described in the manual
 https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/surfice:MainPage#Overlay_a_normalized_SPM_or_FSL_statistical_map
you can load an isosurface mesh, for example the motor_4t95mesh.mz3 that is included with the software. This has only one brightness defined with it, which was set when the mesh was created (e.g. with Advanced/ConvertVoxelwiseToMesh). The other option is to paint your background image with an overlay, for example adding the example image 'motor_4t95vol.nii.gz'. In this case you should be able to adjust the threshold levels. I can not replicate your problem, but I wonder if your image was pre-thresholded. Can you try loading the "BrainMesh_ICBM152Left.mz3" with File/Open and then loading 'motor_4t95vol.nii.gz' with overlay/add. Then try adjusting the min/max levels in the overlay window. Once you change the min or max value, hit the return key to apply the new threshold. This should help you troubleshoot how the software works. It might be worth examining your intended overlay image image MRIcroGL to check it is normalized to a standard template.

I can try this with quality flags/parameters maxxed out with nii2mesh to see if we can get a higher fidelity mesh out of just the IC files alone. We can then import them into UE5 as separate 3d meshes that we can color/texture and overlay onto the base brain

Message: If we could, however, get a mesh out of an individual IC3_run1.nii.gz file, we could texture/color it independently and position it in 3D space (and overlay it on top of the basic brain) in UE5, but that approach produced no mesh unfortunately.

Message: I guess STL is not a good fit for overlaying each of the IC files since STL only encodes geometry information without color/texture. 

We also tried simply loading IC3_run1.nii.gz into mango, build surface --> .vtk and viewed it in fusion360 before converting to .fbx. But that gave us a hollow cube with no mesh. So that's where we are currently stuck.

Message: I just saw that utility myself! It is by the same guy that wrote surfice (Chris Rorden).  The original IC file I provided was just a 3D NIfTI file in standard space.  It is not so much a pretty brain, as it is a statistical image with gradient values representing the relative presence or absence of that component.  Surfice, of course, lets you display the ICs on top of a nice standard brain, and then even build a little animation, like one where IC3_run1 morphs and merges into IC3_run2 and then IC3_run3 etc.  What this illustrates s how the brain's activity is changing as it learns from one run to the next.

I'm hoping maybe this context helps...as maybe it was lost over the months?

I'm ignorant, but thinking STL isn't good for handling gradients??

I notice the nii2mesh examples are for anatomical data, which easily becomes a surface because it doesn't have to represent a continuous gradient of activity.

Message: Also, when it comes to the IC3_run1_video.webm video file that you guys shared, did you use this  "niitomesh" utility as found on this github repo to achieve the .stl file loaded into the video? I'm guessing from the file title on the blender window from the  "IC3_run1_video.webm" video shared on box. 

Would there be any advantage to use that utility (in terms of fidelity or anything else)? We can work with .stl since we can get that to .fbx easily with blendere/fusion360 (we used fusion360 today).

I'm trying out your suggestion with segmentation->export. I suppose a key struggle of ours is simply understanding the .nii format itself and segmentation

But then, for example: Segmentation ‚Üí Export as surface mesh‚Üí STL Mesh file.  Note that surfice provides some surface format images AND that under "Advanced" Surfice offers the option to export voxelwise volumes to surfaces (I have not done this, but it seems promising).  

Thank you, all of you, for playing with this data!

If you want a higher detailed mesh just hit repair again. Rebuild and just set your density to max. After all that save then just file export as a .fbx through fusion.

I got multi-user editing working using a mobile hotspot from my phone. Both the physical machines running Unreal need to be on the same access point for it to work; the client-server connection for multi-user editing fails if either of those machines are hosting the mobile hotspot. A workaround to avoid using a phone as a mobile hotspot is using Hamachi to create a virtual network, I believe Denisse and team were successful with getting multi-user editing working using Hamachi with the minor downside of being limited to 5 devices connecting to the virtual access point (I think we have <=5 people per XR team anyways) Maryam is bringing in a portable hotspot from the main library that we can experiment with and see if that has any upsides to using that over Hamachi. 

I'm getting the environment set up on the new workstation so it's accessible to all XR teams and documenting how I'm configuring the workstation (UE5, android studio, Meta quest dev programs, etc, copying the 5.4 source build files from my machine over LAN) I'm also following along the guide you linked. We should have a .apk build for produced by the new workstation for the Quest 3 by EOD today.

If it does, that's huge progress and we should start to think UI.  Several of us have discussed that while NANO 2020 was a cool starting point we could be much better off building new in a proper XR direction (as opposed to the VR experience that NANO 2020 was built for).  Most likely that means breaking out Meta's XR API for Mixed Reality... https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unreal/unreal-engine/ - When last investigated <@1246596594841944116> determined that Meta's approach requires a source build of UE5 with the Meta Plugin natively built into their version of the engine.

Message: <@&1232060265428811847> It might be worth looking into how we can collaborate on the building process the UE5 projects. The idea right now is to run the UE5 editor on our local machines and then export that to run on beefy workstation at the XR room.

Message: <@&1254877766969462794> So the current step for us is:
looking at the fmri scan files and seeing how we can port the files into UE5 assets. 
Check the files on the google drive (link on google doc)

Message: <@&1254877766969462794> I have the NANO 2020 build (on flash drive) with me and whoever is on shift can grab it from me today.  The first thing to do is to get this application to run in the Unity game engine so that it can be experienced.  <@1246596594841944116> was able to do this in early June but this team will need to retrace those steps.  Once the crew understands how to load and experience NANO 2020 we can have a review of it and then determine next steps for XR development based on what this experience proves is possible.  See you at the shop.

We do still need to get access to the original NANO 2020 to have a better feel for it, but we made good progress
