Definitely any info you have on the portfolio of projects is helpful - either if you throw together additional creatives, or if you just send me text, my virtual assistant can design more fliers/whitepapers etc. It might be helpful to get on a brainstorming call as well to discuss more the types of projects and employers we want to target as well as what the process would look like once we have a client wanting to start.

Message: Thank you <@1249851179735973968> my first glance is that this looks AWESOME.  I mean that from a deep, instinctual level.  The moment I saw the flyer I realized this is going to work.  Such a good idea.  Second reaction is... let us work on our end a bit with this (our media/web, not the flyer).  I want to task the <@&1253453459240259594> crew with dressing this up a bit, and I want to run it by a few folks at the UA.  We have time.  We should lean into the 'GPT Showcase' page our <@&1229905767302168587> crew is publishing as a 'teaser' or 'portfolio' function for your potential customers to peruse, we can also pull together more creative on our end.

Message: Hi Ash, sorry, missed this message before. I have begun marketing as of last week with the attached flier. Got one person potentially interested so far who I'm trying to get on a call with to hear about his project/idea. The only deliverable I can think of is if you could provide a basic "menu" of possible projects that can be done, in "5th grader language", I think it will help make things more tangible to employers. Even just an overview of all the projects in this AI Core program currently would be helpful to show examples of what can be done. Of course we can entertain projects proposed outside of the menu options as well. Also, would you be willing to do a LinkedIn Live with me to discuss AI in general and the program/our partnership to help promote it? It would be a 30-minute video session, interview style, no prep required.

You can paste the code in ChatGPT and ask it to explain it to you. The "Working OpenAI Resume Bot.ipynb" is what I want you to go through and when you come in tomorrow we can all activate the chatbot on your system and let you know of the work going ahead.
